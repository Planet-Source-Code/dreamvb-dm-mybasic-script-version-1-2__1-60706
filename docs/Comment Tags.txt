Comment Header Tags

You can use comment header to show information on your scripts. 
This can include your user name date or time a list below shows the tags.

Please note that some tags will not show. At once so you will need to save your scripts before adding the comment header. 
This is only if you intend to use the extended tag information.

To edit the Comment Header you can open the text file in note pad.
Or from the IDE go to Tool->Options see comment header

Comment Header Text file is located in your data folder 
\data\Comment header.txt
