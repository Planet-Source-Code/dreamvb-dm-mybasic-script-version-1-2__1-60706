One quick note I have left a Batch file for UPX.
You can use it compress engine.exe if needed.

UPX can be freely downloadable from http://www.upx.org/
Once downloaded place the UPX program inside the engine folder and run the UPX batch file

Note update should be ready soon. But if you can’t wait then you can
Find any nightly builds or updates from the live update program in the IDE
